# Prime Spectoscopy
 Analyse subsequences of primes using Fourier analysis.

 The talk I gave at the NTDU in September is the notebook PrimeSpectroscopyNTDU9.ipynb

 The latest version of the code is in the file PrimeSpectroscopyTools.sage

 Just load it using load("PrimeSpectroscopyTools.sage") in a notebook cell,
 instead of the running the long cell containing the older code.

 Amongst the improvements is a significant speedup using fast_callables.
